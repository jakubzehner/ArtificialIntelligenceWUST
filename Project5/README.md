# **Deep learning**

A neural network that predicts the evaluation of the ridiculousness of jokes.

Dataset: [Jester dataset](https://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/)

Jupyter notebook includes loading the data and creating some simple neural networks, the task is not finished (because I did not have to do it) and probably will never be finished, because the very small number of jokes (100) makes the task of creating a good neural network for this data not interesting to me (and probably not possible?).
